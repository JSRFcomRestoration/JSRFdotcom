You can skate, grind, do some air tricks until you bump into "something"...<br>
The basic control for players actions is much easier compared to Jet Grind.<br>
Using the directional pad and jump button let you pull some cool looking air tricks like...<br>

And you tag all over the city of Tokyo! <br>
You keep movin' and taggin' until the town gets full of art, and full of graffiti! <br>

<b><font color="orange">What is "Graffiti"...</font></b><br>
Graffiti is a street art by which people spray-paint on a wall to express themselves. You can tag almost anywhere you want in the game. <br>
BUT Remember not to do that in real life so you can keep your own town happy! <br>

<br>
...say what? "you think it seems hard to be the master?" <br>
No worries. It's gonna be much easier than Jet Grind Radio. <br>
